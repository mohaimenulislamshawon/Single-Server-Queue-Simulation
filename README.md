# Single-Server-Queue-Simulation
This repository contains a single server queue simulation implemented in PHP, complete with a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS. The simulation models the behavior of customers arriving at a service point, where they may have to wait if the server is busy, and their interactions with the server.
